## The Trump Years

When the time came for the Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Learning portion of my bootcamp experience, I wanted to produce a project that would have a little comedy to it and relevant. Being an avid reader (and while in bootcamp I filled the void becoming a very active Luminary consumer - podcasts became the new book for the three months I attended Metis), this was the project I was looking forward to the most. Being stuck inside because of quarantine and further confined to my desk to make bootcamp and data science my priority, I thought that using the Trump press briefings and releases for an analysis via NLP would be interesting and provide a summary to reference for the, then, upcoming election.
